# Inductive-Ductal-Carcinoma-Analysis
A CNN that has been trained for detecting IDC using the BreCaHAD dataset.

This CNN has been trained for detecting IDC in patients and an accuracy of 83 percent is achievable by using only 32% of the entire dataset that is available. 

This can be extended for the entire dataset but computational limitations hold back this model. 


This has been using the Keras python module with Tensorflow as backend.
