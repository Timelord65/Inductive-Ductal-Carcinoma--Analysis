# Invasive-Ductal-Carcinoma-Analysis


Invasive Ductal Carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. The chances of survival for 5 years after being diagnosed is 77 - 90 percent depending on the stage at which it was diagnosed. The famed BreCaHAD dataset has been used to train the model which contains 162 images.

The dataset used here is based on the BreCaHAD dataset, where the 162 original images are sliced into 277524 images which can be used for training the model. 

This CNN has been trained for detecting IDC in patients and an accuracy of 83 percent is achievable by using only 32% of the entire dataset that is available.
